###Introduction

Reading habit is one of the best characteristics that a man can possess. Once the habit of
reading books grows in one, it seldom dies out. It is said that a book is one's best friend in
life. By reading a good book, one can not only earn knowledge but also gain experience in
life, and realize the eternal truth. A good book can guide one in the right direction in his
life's journey.

However, reading hard cover books has gone away slowly. As, this is an era of internet
and smart technologies, people are so much used to these technologies that many of the
current lifestyle and habits are becoming obsolete rapidly. People now like to read books
on their smart devices like smart phones, tablets, laptops and personal computers as there
is a wide range of reading materials are available in various formats to read in those
devices.

Bangladesh is also becoming digitalized at a great pace. For this reason, book selling is
decreasing in an alarming rate. So, book publishers and writers are having hard times.
Also, internet is full of pirated books which are typically made from scan copies of hard
cover books. So, the writers canâ€™t get the royalty of books they deserve. Moreover, those
books are not user friendly and most of the time, those induce annoyance to the readers.

Considering all these key points in mind, we have taken an effort to provide the book
lovers a wide range of books in Portable Document Format (.pdf) format at a minimum
price so that the thirst of the book lovers can be met. Also, the book publishing industry
can revive from their hard times. We will develop a web application that will provide an
online interface to show catalog of books, details book description and download books
online. We will also include a Business Intelligence (BI) component that will provide
Digital Visualization System (DVS) to show the trends and patterns about selling of books.
